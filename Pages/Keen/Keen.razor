        Keen is a framework for Kotlin that leverages evolutionary algorithms to solve optimization problems.
        It harnesses the power and expressiveness of Kotlin to provide an intuitive and efficient interface for researchers,
        scientists, and developers alike.
        With Keen, you can build and fine-tune complex evolutionary algorithms with just a few lines of code.

        Whether you are delving into genetic algorithms for the first time or are an experienced researcher looking for a
        Kotlin-native tool, Keen offers a streamlined experience without sacrificing depth or flexibility. Its modular
        architecture means you can easily extend or modify components, from selection and crossover methods to mutation and
        fitness evaluation.
